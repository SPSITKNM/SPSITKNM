# Binary Search Tree Implementation Assignment 

## Task Description
Implement a complete binary search tree with the following requirements:

## Functional Requirements

### Binary Search Tree Operations
- Construct the binary tree through sequential integer insertions
- Implement the following methods:
  - `insert(item)`
  - `delete(item)`
  - Inorder traversal
  - Preorder traversal
  - Postorder traversal

### Traversal Output Specifications
- Traversal outputs should print values separated by spaces to `std::cout`

## Delete Operation Specification
- If the item is not in the tree, do not modify the tree
- When deleting a node, correctly reattach any disconnected subtrees
- For nodes with two children, use one of these strategies:
  1. Copy the in-order successor's value (smallest node in right subtree)
  2. Copy the in-order predecessor's value (largest node in left subtree)
  3. Then remove the original successor/predecessor node

## Level-Order Printing
Implement a function to print the tree "by levels":
- First line: root node
- Subsequent lines: node children
- Maintain tree structure in output
- Use 'X' to represent missing children
- Example output format:
  ```
  root
  left_child right_child
  left_grandchild right_grandchild left_grandchild right_grandchild
  ```

## Program Input and Output

# Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm Assignment

## Problem Description
Implement Kruskal's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted, connected graph.

## Algorithm Requirements

### Input
- A weighted graph represented as an adjacency matrix
- `0` indicates no edge between vertices
- Non-zero values represent edge weights

### Output
- Total weight of the Minimum Spanning Tree

### Algorithm Steps
1. Sort all edges in non-decreasing order of their weights
2. Use Union-Find data structure to detect cycles
3. Select edges that do not form a cycle
4. Stop when MST contains `|V| - 1` edges

## Implementation Details

### Union-Find Data Structure
- Implement with path compression
- Use union by rank optimization
- Efficiently handle set operations and cycle detection

### Key Functions
- `find(x)`: Find the representative/root of a set
- `unionSets(x, y)`: Merge two sets, return false if would create a cycle

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1

```
0 2 0 6 0
2 0 3 8 5
0 3 0 0 7
6 8 0 0 9

# Subset Sum Problem Assignment

## Problem Description
Write a program that finds all subsets of a given set of positive integers that sum up to a target value.

## Algorithmic Approach
Implement a backtracking algorithm to solve the subset sum problem:
- Explore all possible subset combinations
- Use recursive approach to generate subsets
- Prune unnecessary branches by tracking current sum

## Problem Requirements

### Input Specification
1. Input file format:
   - Contains a sequence of positive integers
   - Numbers are space-separated on a single line
2. Command-line arguments:
   - Filename containing input numbers
   - Target sum value

### Output Specification
- Print the total number of subsets that sum exactly to the target value
- Output should be a single integer

## Algorithm Design Guidelines
- Use recursive backtracking technique
- For each element, decide whether to:
  - Include it in the current subset
  - Exclude it from the current subset
- Optimize by stopping search branches that exceed target sum

## Example Test Cases

### Test Case 1
- Input file: `2 3 5 7`
- Target sum: `10`
- Expected output: `2`
- Explanation: Possible subsets are [2,3,5] and [3,7]

### Test Case 2
- Input file: `2 3 5 7`
- Target sum: `50`
- Expected output: `0`
- Explanation: No subset sums exactly to 50

## Implementation Constraints
- Use C++ 
- Implement recursive backtracking
- Handle input file parsing
- Efficiently track and count valid subsets

## Additional Challenges
- Consider time and space complexity
- Optimize pruning of search branches
- Handle large input sets efficiently

## Recommended Resources
- Levitin's Algorithm Design book
- Algorithms textbooks covering backtracking techniques
- Online algorithm design resources

## Submission Requirements
- Submit a single `main.cpp` file
- Ensure clean, readable code
- Include appropriate comments
- Handle potential input errors

## Hints
- Use vector to store input numbers
- Recursive function should take current index, current sum, and current subset
- Backtrack by including/excluding each number
- Prune branches that exceed target sum
